# Pended Claims Queue Dashboard
## Background
During my tenure at Commonwealth Care Alliance, I was tasked with creating a data dashboard 

Medical claims can pend for a variety of reasons. While CCA had multiple different queues for pended claims, for simplicity's sake, this project outline only focuses on the primary pending claims queue.

## Dashboard Overview
While all parts of this dashboard reflect the layout of the original project, for obvious reasons the original data couldn't be used. This PowerBI dashboard sources synthetic Medicare claims data provided by CMS. You can find this dataset at:
